> Harissa or harissa is a red pepper purée native to Tunisia. The chilies are dried in the sun and then ground with spices such as cumin, coriander, caraway and sun-dried tomatoes. However, harissa can also be prepared with fresh peppers or steamed and mixed peppers. Harissa is usually sold in cans, but can also be found in tubes. There are regional varieties depending on the type of pepper, taste and preparation. Thus, Berber harissa is prepared with dried cayenne pepper, garlic, oil, salt and some spices.
