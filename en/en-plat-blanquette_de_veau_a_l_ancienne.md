## Instructions:
### Calf Preparation
 1. Cut the meat into cubes and put them in a Dutch oven. Cover with cold water and bring to a boil. Keep boiling for 5 minutes, then drain the meat in a colander. Rinse with cold water.
 1. Peel the onion and prick it with the cloves. Cut carrots into rings. Split the leek lengthwise and wash under cold water to remove all traces of soil.
 1. Put the meat back in the Dutch oven. Add onion, carrots, leek, celery, garlic and bouquet garni. Pour in the broth and season with salt and pepper.
 1. Bring to a boil and skim if necessary. Cover and simmer for 1h30 over low heat.

### Preparing Baby Onions
 1. Peel and wash baby onions. Put them in a frying pan and cover halfway with cold water. Add butter as well as salt and sugar.
 1. Cut a disc of parchment paper with the same diameter as the pan and pierce it in the middle. Cover the onions with this sheet. Cook over low heat until the liquid has evaporated.

### Preparing Paris Mushrooms
 1. Clean the button mushrooms with a brush and mince them. Put them in a small saucepan of cold water and add the butter, lemon juice and a pinch of salt.
 1. Cook at a simmer for 15 minutes. Drain with a slotted spoon and set aside.

### Preparing the Sauce
 1. In another saucepan, melt the butter and pour in the flour to make a roux. Mix and cook for 2 minutes without stopping stirring with a whisk.
 1. Take 50 cl of the cooking broth from the blanquette and pour it gradually, always stirring with a whisk. Cook for a few minutes until you get a thick sauce. Season with salt and pepper.

### Finishing

 1. Drain the meat with a slotted spoon and put it in a casserole dish. Pour in the sauce, baby onions and mushrooms. Heat for a few minutes over low heat while mixing.
 1. Mix the heavy cream and egg yolk in a bowl with a whisk. Remove the casserole from the heat and pour this binding into it. Mix and heat over low heat.
 1. Add the lemon juice and adjust the seasoning if necessary. Serve hot.
