## Instructions:
### Preparing the veal
 1. Cut the meat into cubes and put them in a stewpot. Cover with cold water and bring to a boil. Keep boiling for 5 minutes, then drain the meat in a sieve. Rinse off with cold water.
 1. Peel the onion and prick it with the cloves. Slice carrots into slices. Split the leek lengthwise and wash under cold water to remove any trace of soil.
 1. Put the meat back in the pot. Add onion, carrots, leeks, celery, garlic, and garnished bouquet. Pour in the broth then season with salt and pepper.
 1. Bring to a boil and skim off if necessary. Cover and simmer for 1.5 hours on low heat.

### Preparing baby onions
 1. Peel and wash baby onions. Place them in a skillet and cover halfway with cold water. Add butter, salt and sugar.
 1. Cut a disc of parchment paper with the same diameter as the pan and pierce it in the middle. Cover the onions with this sheet. Cook on low heat until liquid evaporates.

### Preparing Paris mushrooms
 1. Clean the button mushrooms with a brush and slice them thinly. Place them in a small pot of cold water and add the butter, lemon juice and a pinch of salt.
 1. Cook to a simmer for 15 minutes. Drain with a skimmer and set aside.

### Preparing the sauce
 1. In another pan, melt the butter and pour in the flour to make a roux. Mix and cook for 2 minutes without stopping stirring with a whisk.
 1. Scoop 50 cl of the cooking broth from the blanquette and pour it in gradually, still stirring with a whisk. Cook for a few minutes until a thick sauce is obtained. Season with salt and pepper.

### Finishing

 1. Drain the meat with a skimmer and place it in a casserole dish. Pour in the sauce, baby onions and mushrooms. Heat for a few minutes on low heat while stirring.
 1. Whisk together the heavy cream and egg yolk in a bowl. Remove the casserole from the heat and pour this mixture into it. Mix and heat over low heat.
 1. Add lemon juice and adjust seasoning if necessary. Serve hot.
