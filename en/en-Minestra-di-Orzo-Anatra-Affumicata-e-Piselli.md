# Minestra di Orzo, Anatra Affumicata e Piselli

> I replaced the pancetta with smoked duck breast, which is probably sacrilege for purists. This gives a super interesting dimension to this excellent soup.

## Details:
* Serves: 6 people
* Preparation time: 5 mins
* Cooking time: 25 mins
* Total time: 30 mins

## Ingredients:
* 1 tablespoon unsalted butter
* 1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil
* 1 finely chopped white onion
* 80g smoked duck breast, finely diced
* 1 to 2 sprigs of fresh thyme or marjoram
* salt and pepper
* 1.5l chicken stock
* 80g freshly grated Parmesan
* 100g of orzo or conchigliette
* 280g fresh or frozen peas

## Instructions:
1. Heat butter and olive oil in a heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium heat. When the butter has melted, add the onion and the diced smoked duck breast, stirring to coat well.
1. Saute for five minutes, reducing heat to medium-low if necessary to prevent onion from burning. 
1. Sprinkle with thyme or marjoram and a generous amount of pepper and continue to stir-fry for another five minutes, or until the onion is translucent and the diced smoked duck breast is just beginning to crisp but still tender.
1. Pour in broth; bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Stir in pasta and peas.
1. Cook until al dente (cooking time will depend on brand and shape).
1. Add a little more broth if the soup seems too thick.
1. Remove the soup from the heat and stir in the parmesan. Taste and add extra salt and pepper, if desired.
1. Pour it into shallow bowls and sprinkle with the rest of the cheese. Serve immediately.
