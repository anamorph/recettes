# Banana Bread 

> During the Great Depression, which began with the stock market crash of 1929 and lasted for much of the 1930s, every piece of food became valuable. Households were not willing to throw anything away - even a “rotten” banana. The first recipes for Banana Bread began to bloom in cooking recipe manuals. This classic is now celebrated on 23 February, officially declared Banana Bread Day!
