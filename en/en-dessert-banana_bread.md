# Banana Bread 

> During the Great Depression, which began with the 1929 stock market crash and lasted for much of the 1930s, every piece of food became valuable. Households were unwilling to throw anything away - even a “rotten” banana. The first Banana Bread recipes began to bloom in cooking recipe manuals. This classic is now celebrated on February 23, officially declared Banana Bread Day!
