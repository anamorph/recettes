# Marengo calf my way

> Marengo is first of all a village in northern Italy (Piedmont). Napoleon Bonaparte won a victory there in 1800.
> The battle raged all day long on June 14, 1800 in Marengo, the victory of Bonaparte and his generals awakened the stomach of the first Consul. Cook Dunan is embarrassed because the advance of the French troops has isolated him from the supply vans. So he decided to use all the products available to him, he managed to gather chicken, tomatoes, garlic, green parsley. He saut√©ed the chicken with olive oil and gradually added the foods he found.
