## Ingredients:
* 1 good-sized cauliflower
* 1 medium red onion

* 1 large carrot or two medium carrots
* 30g melted butter
* 2 teaspoon zaatar -*oriental blend of oregano, sumac, marjoram and sesame*
* 1 tablespoon fine, strong mustard
* 1 liter of chicken stock
* 250 ml of semi-skimmed milk
* a little bit of fresh dill

## Instructions:
0. Preheat your oven, 220°C (425°F), rotating heat.
1. Break the cauliflower into medium-sized florets, peel the carrots and cut them into pieces about 1.5 cm wide. Place vegetables on a cookie sheet.
2. Melt the butter and pour it over the vegetables and season with salt. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes without forgetting to turn the vegetables halfway through cooking. They will be nicely browned at the end of cooking.

5. Add the milk and remove from the heat. Let it cool for about ten minutes.
6. Blend the cream soup until smooth. Rectify salt and pepper.
7. Just before serving, add a pinch of sumac and a few dill florets.
8. Optional: You can garnish with croutons of bread or even a few roasted cauliflower florets reserved beforehand.
