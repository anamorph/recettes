# Osso Buco with gremolata

> Osso Buco (literally translated into French as “bone with holes”) is a traditional Milanese dish, very fragrant, consisting of a stew of sections (or rolls) of veal shank, braised in dry white wine and decorated with vegetables (carrots, tomatoes and leeks) that is generally served with Milanese risotto. The marrow is cooked and served with the bone.
> This traditional variant called gremolata without tomatoes is enhanced with minced garlic, lemon zest (when it is said “with gremolata”) and finely chopped fresh herbs.

## Instructions:

5. Heat the oven to 170°C
6. Heat your cast iron casserole with 3 tablespoons of olive oil

9. After a few minutes, reserve the juice and pour it over the meat
10. Saute the carrots, onions and celery in the casserole with 1 tablespoon of olive oil and season
11. Add the garlic head cut in half then the garnished bouquet and brown for 5 minutes.
12. Place the shank slices on top of the vegetables, with their juice, and cover the edge with the broth.
13. Bake for 2 hours at 170°C
14. At the end of cooking, remove the casserole from the oven then reserve the shank slices
15. Remove the garlic and the garnished bouquet, then pass the vegetables in a hand blender
16. Prepare the gremolata. Zest the lemon, chop the parsley, sage, rosemary and garlic very finely. Mix and combine with 1 tablespoon of olive oil and lemon juice.
