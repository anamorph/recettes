* 30g melted butter
* 2 teaspoons zaatar -*oriental blend of oregano, sumac, marjoram, and sesame*

## Instructions:
0. Preheat your oven, 220°C (425°F), rotating heat.
1. Break the cauliflower into medium-sized florets, peel the carrots and cut them into pieces about 1.5cm wide. Place vegetables on a cookie sheet.
2. Melt the butter and pour it over the vegetables and season with salt. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes without forgetting to turn the vegetables halfway through cooking. They will be nicely browned after cooking.

5. Add milk and remove from heat. Let it cool for ten minutes.
6. Blend the soup until smooth. Adjust salt and pepper.
7. Just before serving, add a pinch of sumac and a few dill florets.
8. Optional: You can garnish with bread croutons or some roasted cauliflower florets reserved beforehand.
