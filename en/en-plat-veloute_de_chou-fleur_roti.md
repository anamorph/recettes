0. Preheat your oven, 220°C (425°f), rotating heat.
1. Untie the cauliflower into medium-sized florets, peel the carrots and cut into sections about 1.5cm wide. Place the vegetables on a cookie sheet.
2. Melt the butter and pour it over the vegetables and salt. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes without forgetting to turn the vegetables halfway. They will be nicely browned at the end of cooking.
3. Meanwhile, in a saucepan, lay the onion, garlic and add the broth. Bring to a boil over low heat.
4. Once the cauliflower and carrots are roasted, add the mustard and zaatar to the broth. Simmer 10 minutes or until vegetables are tender.
5. Add the milk and get out of the heat. Allow to cool for about ten minutes.
6. Mix the velvety until a smooth preparation is obtained. Rectify salt and pepper.
7. When serving, add a pinch of sumac and a few dill florets.
8. Optional: You can add bread croutons or some pre-booked rotis cauliflower florets.
