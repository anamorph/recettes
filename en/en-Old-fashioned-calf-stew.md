# Old-fashioned veal stew

![Old-fashioned veal stew](https://github.com/anamorph/recettes/blob/main/photos/fr-plat-blanquette_de_veau_a_l_ancienne-01.jpg?raw=true)

> Vincent de La Chapelle was the first chef to write a recipe for blanquette, in 1735. At the time, there was only one blanquette: it was made exclusively from veal and consisted of leftover roast meat. It was served as a starter with no other accompaniment than bell onions and button mushrooms. Until the 1870s, numerous variants of the accompaniment of these leftovers were created, especially in sauces created for this purpose and which were more or less complex. It was not until the end of the 19th century that blanquette was made from raw veal, which was then cooked in broth.

## Instructions:
### Preparing the veal
 1. Cut the meat into cubes and put them in a Dutch oven. Cover with cold water and bring to a boil. Boil for 5 minutes, then drain the meat in a sieve. Rinse off with cold water.
 1. Peel the onion and prick it with the cloves. Cut the carrots into slices. Split the leek lengthwise and wash under cold water to remove all traces of soil.
 1. Return the meat to the Dutch oven. Add onion, carrots, leek, celery, garlic, and bouquet garni. Pour in the broth and season with salt and pepper.
 1. Bring to a boil and skim if necessary. Cover and let simmer for 1.5 hours on low heat.

### Preparing baby onions
 1. Peel and wash baby onions. Place them in a skillet and cover halfway with cold water. Add butter, salt and sugar.
 1. Cut a disk of parchment paper with the same diameter as the pan and pierce it in the middle. Cover the onions with this leaf. Cook on low heat until liquid evaporates.

### Preparing the button mushrooms
 1. Clean the button mushrooms with a brush and slice them thinly. Place them in a small pot of cold water and add the butter, lemon juice and a pinch of salt.
 1. Simmer for 15 minutes. Drain with a skimmer and set aside.

### Preparing the sauce
 1. In another saucepan, melt the butter and add the flour to make a roux. Stir and cook for 2 minutes without stopping stirring with a whisk.
 1. Take 50 cl of the cooking broth from the blanquette and add it gradually, always stirring with a whisk. Cook for a few minutes until a thick sauce is obtained. Season with salt and pepper.

### Finishing

 1. Drain the meat using a skimmer and put it in a casserole dish. Add the sauce, baby onions, and mushrooms. Heat for a few minutes on low heat while stirring.
 1. In a bowl, whisk together the heavy cream and egg yolk. Remove the casserole from the heat and add this mixture. Stir and reheat on low heat.
 1. Add lemon juice and adjust seasoning if necessary. Serve hot.
