# Lebanese Maghmour.

> Maghmour is a dish that dates back to the end of the 19th century; sometimes called Lebanese Moussaka. However, it is quite different from the Greek moussaka; a casserole made up of layers of eggplant, béchamel and meat. Moussaka is an Arabic word that means icy. Maghmour is served at room temperature or cool.

## Details:
* Serves: 8 people 
* Prep time: 10 mins
* Cooking time: 60-70 mins
* Total Time: 1 hrs 20 mins

## Ingredients:
* 2 beautiful eggplants ~ 700g total
* 1 yellow onion
* 120g chickpeas (preferably in a box)
* 1 can of peeled tomatoes (400g) well crushed
* 5 cloves garlic
* 1 tablespoon tomato paste
* 1 tablespoon dried mint
* 1 teaspoonful smoked paprika
* 1 teaspoonful espelette pepper
* Salt
* Olive oil

## Instructions:
### Raw chickpeas
 1. Rinse your chickpeas under cold water then transfer them to a small container. Cover with water and let it soak overnight.
 2. The next day, drain and rinse the chickpeas then, in a saucepan, cook them in a little more than their volume of salted water; the chickpeas should be about 2 to 3 centimeters below the surface.
 3. Once the water boils, turn down the heat and cook for about 30 minutes or until soft.

### Chickpeas in a box
 1. Preheat oven to 200°c (~ 400°f)
 2. Cut the eggplants into cubes about 2 cm aside and place them in a salad bowl. Salt and sprinkle with 3 to 4 tablespoons of olive oil. Mix.
 3. Once well mixed, place on a baking tray and bake for 20 to 30 minutes, or until tender and golden.
 4. In a pot, sweat the diced onion in 2 tablespoons of olive oil.
 5. Once the onion is transparent, add the mined garlic.
 6. When the garlic is cooked, add the tomatoes, tomato paste, dried mint, smoked paprika, espelette pepper, chickpeas, and roasted eggplants. Fill the peeled tomatoes with water and add to everything.
 7. Let it simmer for about twenty minutes; the consistency should be that of a stew.
 8. Serve slightly warm or cold with good bread:)
