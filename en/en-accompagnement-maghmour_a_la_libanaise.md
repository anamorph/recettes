## History:
Maghmour is a dish that dates back to the end of the 19th century; sometimes called Moussaka Libanaise. However, it's quite different from Greek moussaka; a casserole made from layers of eggplant, béchamel, and meat. Moussaka is an Arabic word that means frozen. Maghmour is served at room temperature or chilled.

## Instructions:
### Cooking with raw chickpeas
1. Rinse your chickpeas under cold water then transfer them to a small container. Cover with water and let them soak overnight.
1. The following day, drain and rinse the chickpeas and then, in a saucepan, cook them in slightly more than their volume of salted water; the chickpeas should be about 2 to 3 centimeters below the surface.
1. Once the water is boiling, lower the heat and cook for about 30 minutes or until tender.

### Cooking with canned chickpeas
1. Preheat your oven to 200°C (~ 400°F)
1. Cut the eggplants into cubes with a side of about 2cm and place them in a salad bowl. Season with salt and 3 to 4 tablespoons of olive oil. Mix.
1. Once well mixed, place on a baking tray and bake for 20 to 30 minutes, or until tender and golden brown.
1. In a Dutch oven, sweat the diced onion in 2 tablespoons of olive oil.
1. Once the onion is transparent, add the minced garlic.
1. When the garlic is cooked, add the tomatoes, tomato paste, dried mint, smoked paprika, espelette pepper, chickpeas, and grilled eggplants. Fill the container with the peeled tomatoes with water and add everything.
1. Simmer for about 20 minutes; the consistency should be that of a stew.
1. Serve slightly warm or cold with good bread:)
