# Maghmour in the Lebanese style.

> The Maghmur is a dish that dates back to the late 19th century; sometimes called Lebanese Mussaka. However, it is quite different from the Greek moussaka; a casserole consisting of layers of eggplant, béchamel and meat. Moussaka is an Arabic word that means frozen. Maghmour is served at room temperature or cool.
