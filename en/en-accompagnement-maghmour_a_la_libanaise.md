# Lebanese Maghmour.

> Maghmour is a dish that dates back to the end of the 19th century; sometimes called Lebanese Moussaka. However, it is quite different from the Greek moussaka; a casserole made up of layers of eggplant, béchamel and meat. Moussaka is an Arabic word that means frozen. Maghmour is served at room temperature or chilled.
