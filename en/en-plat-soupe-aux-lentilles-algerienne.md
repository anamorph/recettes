# Algerian lentil soup (chorba aadess)

> Chorba (Turkish: çorba), (Persian: شوربا), (Amharic: Scorba), chorwa (Pashto: شوروا), churpa (Russian: шурпа), chorpa (Uighur: شورها), chorpo (Kyrgyz: шорпо), and sorpa (Kazakh: сорпрпо (а) is a traditional soup from North Africa, the Balkans, Eastern Europe, Central Asia, the Middle East and South Asia. This lentil soup is usually eaten in winter even though there is no need for excuses to consume it throughout the year. It also provides folic acid and the dietary fibre content of lentils is exceptional.
