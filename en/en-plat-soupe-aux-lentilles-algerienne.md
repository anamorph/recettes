# Algerian lentil soup (chorba aadess)

> Chorba (Turkish: Çorba), (Persian: Magora), (Amharic:), Chorwa (Pashto: Magora), Churpa (Russian: Shurpa), Chorpa (Uyghur: Magyra), Chorpo (Kyrgyz: Shorpo), and Sorpa (Kazakh: sorpa) is a traditional soup from North Africa, the Balkans, Eastern Europe, Central Asia, the Middle East and South Asia. This lentil soup is usually consumed in winter even if you don't need excuses to consume it throughout the year. It also provides folic acid and the dietary fiber content of lentils is exceptional.
