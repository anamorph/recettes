## Details:
* Serves: 4 people
* Prep time: 30 mins
* Cooking time: 150 mins
* Total Time: 3 hrs 00 mins

## Ingredients:
* 500g of beef chuck (I use low-fat meat)
* 1 yellow onion cut into small dice
* 4 cloves garlic, chopped
* 1 piece of fresh ginger (~ 5cm x 2cm x 2cm) rapped
* 3 tablespoons madras curry
* 450ml water
* 1 beef broth
* 1 medium golden apple puree (add 10cl of water to make a nice raw puree)
* 1 large tablespoon tomato paste
* 4 tablespoons soy sauce
* 1 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
* 1 medium carrot cut into a bevel, 1cm thick rings
* 1 large Russet potato, in 2cm thick pieces
* Salt
* neutral vegetable oil for cooking (I use rapeseed)
* jasmine rice to serve


## Instructions:
1. Cut the meat into 4cm cubes and sprinkle with a generous pinch of salt. Mix to coat. 
1. In a heavy-bottomed pot (the one you use for curry), add just enough vegetable oil to coat the bottom and heat over medium-high heat until the oil is very hot. Add beef to the pan without crumping it up (you may need to do it in 2 batches). 
1. Let sear without stirring until golden brown, then turn over and grab the other sides and repeat until at least 3 sides are golden brown. Watch the temperature and make sure you don't burn the brown stuff (Maillard's reaction!) which is at the bottom of the pan. Remove the beef and set it aside.
1. In the same saucepan, add the onion, garlic, ginger and fry over medium heat for a few minutes until the onion is soft and translucent.
1. Add the tomato paste and fry for a minute. Add the madras curry powder and toast the spices for another thirty seconds.
1. Add beef broth, apple puree, seared beef, soy sauce and Worcestershire sauce. Cover and simmer over low heat for at least 2 hours or until beef is almost fork tender.
1. Once the beef has simmered, add the carrot, potato and simmer for another 20 minutes until the potato and carrots are tender. 
1. Taste and adjust the seasoning by adding a little more soy sauce.
1. Serve with jasmine rice
