## Details:
* Serves: 4 people
* Prep time: 30 mins
* Cooking time: 150 mins
* Total Time: 3 hrs 00 mins

## Ingredients:
* 500g beef steak (I use low-fat meat)
* 1 yellow onion, finely diced
* 4 grated garlic cloves
* 1 piece of fresh ginger (~ 5cm x 2cm x 2cm) grated
* 3 tablespoons of Japanese curry spice mix
* 450ml of water
* 1 beef bouillon cube
* 1 medium golden apple puree (add 10cl of water to make a nice raw purée)
* 1 big tablespoon tomato paste
* 4 tablespoons soy sauce
* 1 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
* 1 medium carrot cut at an angle, 1cm thick slices
* 1 large Russet potato, cut into 2cm thick pieces
* Salt
* neutral vegetable cooking oil (I use rapeseed)
* jasmine rice to serve
* Fukujinzuke pickles (optional)


## Instructions:
1. Cut the meat into 4cm cubes and sprinkle with a generous pinch of salt. Toss to coat. 
1. In a heavy-bottomed Dutch oven (the one you use for curry), add just enough vegetable oil to coat the bottom and heat over medium-high heat until the oil is very hot. Add beef to the pot without piling it up (you may need to do this in 2 batches). 
1. Sear without stirring until golden brown, then flip and sear the other sides and repeat until at least 3 sides are browned. Watch the temperature and make sure not to burn the brown stuff (the Maillard reaction!) which is at the bottom of the pan. Remove the beef and set it aside.
1. In the same pot, add the onion, garlic, and ginger and saute over medium heat for a few minutes until the onion is soft and translucent.
1. Add tomato paste and saute for one minute. Add madras curry powder and roast the spices for thirty more seconds.
1. Add beef stock, apple purée, seared beef, soy sauce, and Worcestershire sauce. Cover and simmer on low heat for at least 2 hours or until the beef is almost fork tender.
1. Once the beef has simmered, add the carrot, potato and simmer for another 20 minutes until the potato and carrots are tender. 
1. Taste and adjust the seasoning by adding a little more soy sauce.
1. Serve with jasmine rice
