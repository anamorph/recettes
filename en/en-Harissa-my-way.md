> Harissa or harissa is a red pepper puree from Tunisia. The chilies are dried in the sun and then ground with spices, such as cumin, coriander, caraway and dried tomatoes. However, harissa is also prepared with fresh chilies or steamed and mixed chilies. Harissa is usually sold in cans, but can also be found in tubes. There are regional varieties depending on the type of pepper, taste and preparation. Thus, Berber harissa is prepared with dried cayenne pepper, garlic, oil, salt and some spices.
