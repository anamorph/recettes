## Details:
* Serves: 4 people
* Preparation time: 30 mins
* Cooking time: 150 mins
* **Total Time**: 3 hrs

## Ingredients:
* 500g beef chuck (I use low-fat meat)
* 1 yellow onion cut into small cubes
* 4 grated garlic cloves
* 1 piece of fresh ginger (~ 5cm x 2cm x 2cm) grated
* 3 tablespoons Japanese curry spice mix
* 450ml of water
* 1 beef bouillon cube
* 1 medium golden apple puree (add 10cl of water to make a nice raw purée)
* 1 large tablespoon of tomato paste
* 4 tablespoons soy sauce
* 1 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
* 1 medium carrot cut at an angle, 1cm thick slices
* 1 large Russet potato, in 2cm thick pieces
* Salt
* neutral vegetable cooking oil (I use rapeseed)
* jasmine rice to serve
* Fukujinzuke pickles (optional)


## Instructions:
1. Cut the meat into 4cm cubes and sprinkle with a generous pinch of salt. Toss to coat. 
1. In a heavy-bottomed Dutch oven (the one you use for curry), add just enough vegetable oil to coat the bottom and heat over medium-high heat until the oil is very hot. Add beef to the pot without piling it up (you may need to do this in 2 batches). 
1. Sear without stirring until golden brown, then flip and sear the other sides and repeat until at least 3 sides are golden brown. Watch the temperature and make sure you don't burn the brown stuff (the Maillard reaction!) that is at the bottom of the pan. Remove beef and set aside.
1. In the same pot, add the onion, garlic, and ginger and saute over medium heat for a few minutes until the onion is soft and translucent.
1. Add the tomato paste and saute for one minute. Add the madras curry powder and toast the spices for 30 more seconds.
1. Add beef broth, apple purée, seared beef, soy sauce, and Worcestershire sauce. Cover and simmer on low heat for at least 2 hours or until beef is almost fork-tender.
1. Once the beef has simmered, add the carrot, potato, and simmer for another 20 minutes until the potato and carrots are tender. 
1. Taste and adjust the seasoning by adding a little more soy sauce.
1. Serve with jasmine rice
