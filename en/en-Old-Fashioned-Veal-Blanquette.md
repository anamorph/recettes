# Old-fashioned veal stew

![Old-fashioned veal stew](https://github.com/anamorph/recettes/blob/main/photos/fr-plat-blanquette_de_veau_a_l_ancienne-01.jpg?raw=true)

> Vincent de La Chapelle was the first cook to write a recipe for blanquette, in 1735. At the time, only blanquette existed: it was made exclusively from veal and consisted of leftover roast. It was served as a starter with no side dish other than baby onions and button mushrooms. Until the 1870s, numerous variants were created concerning the accompaniment of these leftovers, in particular in sauces created for this purpose and which were more or less complex. It was not until the end of the 19th century that blanquette was made from raw veal meat, which was then cooked in broth.

## Instructions:
### Preparing the veal
 1. Cut the meat into cubes and put them in a stewpot. Cover with cold water and bring to a boil. Boil for 5 minutes, then drain the meat in a colander. Rinse off with cold water.
 1. Peel the onion and prick it with the cloves. Cut the carrots into slices. Split the leek lengthwise and wash under cold water to remove all traces of soil.
 1. Put the meat back into the Dutch oven. Add onion, carrots, leek, celery, garlic, and garni bouquet. Pour in the broth and season with salt and pepper.
 1. Bring to a boil and skim if necessary. Cover and simmer for 1.5 hours on low heat.

### Preparing the baby onions
 1. Peel and wash the baby onions. Place them in a skillet and cover halfway with cold water. Add butter as well as salt and sugar.
 1. Cut out a greaseproof paper disc of the same diameter as the pan and pierce it in the middle. Cover the onions with this sheet. Cook on low heat until the liquid evaporates.

### Preparing button mushrooms
 1. Clean button mushrooms with a brush and slice. Place them in a small pot of cold water and add the butter, lemon juice and a pinch of salt.
 1. Cook at low simmer for 15 minutes. Drain with a slotted spoon and set aside.

### Preparing the sauce
 1. In another saucepan, melt the butter and add the flour to make a roux. Stir and cook for 2 minutes without stopping whisking.
 1. Take 50 cl of the cooking broth from the blanquette and pour it gradually, always stirring with a whisk. Cook for a few minutes until thick sauce is obtained. Add salt and pepper.

### Finishing

 1. Drain the meat with a slotted spoon and place it in a casserole. Pour in sauce, bell onions, and mushrooms. Heat for a few minutes on low heat while stirring.
 1. Whisk together thick crème fraîche and egg yolk in a bowl. Remove the casserole from the heat and pour this mixture into it. Stir and heat over low heat.
 1. Add lemon juice and adjust seasoning if necessary. Serve hot.
