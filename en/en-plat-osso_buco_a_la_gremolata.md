# Osso Buco with gremolata

> Osso buco (literally translated into French as “bone troué”) is a traditional Milanese dish, very fragrant, consisting of a stew of veal shanks (or rolls), braised in dry white wine and garnished with vegetables (carrots, tomatoes and leeks) that is generally served with Milanese risotto. The marrow is cooked and served with its bone.
> This traditional variant called gremolata without tomatoes is decorated with minced garlic, lemon zest (when it says “à la gremolata”) and finely chopped fresh herbs.

6. Heat your cast iron casserole with 3 tablespoons of olive oil

10. Saute the carrots, onions and celery in the pot with 1 tablespoon of olive oil and season

13. Bake for 2 hours at 170°C
14. At the end of cooking, remove the casserole from the oven then reserve the shank slices
15. Remove the garlic and the garnished bouquet, then pass the vegetables in a hand blender
