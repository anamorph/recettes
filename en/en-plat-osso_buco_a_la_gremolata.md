# Osso Buco with gremolata

> Osso buco (literally translated into French as “hole bone”) is a traditional Milanese dish, very fragrant, consisting of a stew of stretches (or rolls) of veal shank, braised in dry white wine and embellished with vegetables (carrots, tomatoes and leeks) that are usually served accompanied by Milanese risotto. The marrow is cooked and served with its bone.
> This traditional variant known as gremolata without tomatoes is embellished with a hash of garlic, a lemon zest (when it is said “with gremolata”) and finely chopped fresh herbs.
