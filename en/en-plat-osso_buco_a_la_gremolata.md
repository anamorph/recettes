# Osso Buco with Gremolata

> Osso buco (literally translated in French as “holed bone”) is a traditional Milanese dish, very fragrant, consisting of a stew of pieces (or rolls) of veal shank, braised in dry white wine and embellished with vegetables (carrots, tomatoes and leeks) that are usually served with Milanese risotto. The marrow is cooked and served with her bone.
> This traditional variant called gremolata without tomatoes is embellished with a minced garlic, a lemon zest (when it is said “gremolata”) and finely chopped fresh herbs.
