# Osso Buco in the gremolata

> The osso buco (literally translated into French as “bone troué”) is a traditional Milanese dish, very fragrant, consisting of a stew of stretches (or rolls) of veal shank, braised with dry white wine and embellished with vegetables (carrots, tomatoes and leeks) that is usually served accompanied by Milanese risotto. The marrow is cooked and served with its bone.
> This traditional tomato-free gremolata variant is complemented with a chopped garlic, lemon zest (when called “gremolata”) and finely chopped fresh herbs.
