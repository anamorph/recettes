# Minestra di Orzo, Anatra Affumicata and Piselli

> I replaced the pancetta with smoked breast, which is probably a sacrilege for purists. This gives a super interesting dimension to this excellent soup.

## Details:
* Serves: 6 people
* Preparation time: 5 mins
* Cooking time: 25 mins
* Total Time: 30 mins

## Ingredients:
* 1 tablespoon unsalted butter
* 1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil
* 1 finely chopped white onion
* 80g smoked duck breast, diced
* 1 to 2 branches of fresh thyme or marjoram
* salt and pepper
* 1.5l poultry broth
* 80g freshly grated Parmesan
* 100g orzo or conchigliette
* 280g fresh or frozen peas

## Instructions:
0. Heat butter and olive oil in a thick-bottomed saucepan over medium heat. When the butter is melted, add the onion and diced smoked duck breast, stirring to coat them well.
1. Sauté for five minutes, reducing the heat to medium-low if necessary to prevent the onion from burning. 
2. Sprinkle with thuym or marjoram and a generous grind of pepper and continue to sauté for another five minutes, or until the onion is translucent and the small dices of smoked duck breast are just beginning to crunch, but still tender.
3. Pour broth; bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Stir in pasta and peas.
4. Cook until al dente (cooking time will depend on the brand and shape).
5. Add a little broth if the soup seems too thick.
6. Remove the soup from the heat and stir in the Parmesan cheese. Taste and add extra salt and pepper, if desired.
7. Pour it into shallow bowls and sprinkle with the rest of the cheese. Serve immediately.
