> During the Great Depression, which began with the stock market crash of 1929 and lasted through much of the 1930s, every piece of food became precious. Households were not willing to throw anything away - even a “rotten” banana. The first Banana Bread recipes started to blossom in cookbooks. This classic is now celebrated on February 23, officially declared Banana Bread Day!
