# Osso Buco with gremolata

> Osso buco (literally translated into French as “holed bone”) is a traditional Milanese dish, very fragrant, consisting of a stew of segments (or rolls) of veal knuckle, braised in dry white wine and decorated with vegetables (carrots, tomatoes and leeks) that are usually served with risotto Milanese. The marrow is cooked and served with its bone.
> This traditional variant called gremolata without tomatoes is decorated with minced garlic, lemon zest (when it says “gremolata”) and finely chopped fresh herbs.

1. Heat your cast iron casserole with 3 tablespoons of olive oil

1. Sauté the carrots, onions and celery in the pot with 1 tablespoon of olive oil and season
