# Harissa my way

> Harissa or harissa is a puree of red peppers originally from Tunisia. Chilies are dried in the sun and then ground with spices, including cumin, coriander, caraway and dried tomatoes. However, harissa can also be prepared with fresh peppers or peppers cooked in steam and mixed. Harissa is usually sold in cans, but can also be found in tubes. There are regional varieties depending on the type of chili pepper, taste and preparation. Thus, Berber harissa is prepared with dried cayenne pepper, garlic, oil, salt and some spices.
