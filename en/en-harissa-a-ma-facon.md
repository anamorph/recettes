# Harissa in my way

> Harissa or harissa is a puree of red peppers originating in Tunisia. Chili peppers are dried in the sun and then crushed with spices such as cumin, coriander, caraway and dried tomatoes. However, the harissa is also prepared with fresh peppers or steamed and mixed peppers. Harissa is usually sold in canned canned, but can also be found in tube. There are regional varieties of them depending on the type of peppers, taste and preparation. Thus, the Berber harissa is prepared with dried cayenne pepper, garlic, oil, salt and some spices.
