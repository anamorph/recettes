# Harissa my way

> Harissa or harissa is a red pepper puree from Tunisia. The peppers are dried in the sun and then crushed with spices such as cumin, coriander, caraway and sun-dried tomatoes. However, harissa is also prepared with fresh peppers or steamed and mixed peppers. Harissa is usually sold in cans, but it is also found in tubes. There are regional varieties depending on the type of chili, taste and preparation. Thus, Berber harissa is prepared with dried cayenne pepper, garlic, oil, salt and some spices.
