## History:
Maghmour is a dish that dates back to the end of the 19th century; sometimes called Lebanese Moussaka. However, it is quite different from Greek moussaka; a casserole made from layers of eggplant, béchamel, and meat. Moussaka is an Arabic word that means frozen. Maghmour is served at room temperature or chilled.
