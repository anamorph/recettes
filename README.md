# Recettes
*or the shortest path to my food addiction, documented.*

## TL;DR;
These are the recipes i use on a regular basis. For most of them, they are a personal version of the "original" recipe and are the results of several tests i've done to ensure repeatable satisfaction from my toughest customers yet: my kids !

The initial idea was to create a "forkable" repository and a front-end to experiment with [github pages](https://pages.github.com/).
Somehow, this project now involves ml-powered translation capabilities for my recipes via [Amazon Translate](https://aws.amazon.com/translate/).
